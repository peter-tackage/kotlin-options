# Kotlin Options Moshi Adapter

A module which provides a [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi/) `AdapterFactory` to allow translation from JSON into an `Option` type value.

This allows you to have `Option` properties in your classes to handle nullable and optional (non-present) JSON properties, such as:

```kotlin
    data class Data(val optionField: Option<Int>)
```

Add to your Moshi instance by creating an instance of `OptionAdapterFactory`:

```kotlin
        val moshi = Moshi.Builder()
                 /** etc **/
                .add(OptionAdapterFactory()) // must be before KotlinJsonAdapterFactory
                .add(KotlinJsonAdapterFactory())
                 /** etc **/
                .build()
```
